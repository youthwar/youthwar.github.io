  ## Introduction

  Both of these datastructes are both linear. Linear datastructures allow us to traverse them one by one.
  These are very similar to arrays or linked list but these are more controlled because we have less methods.

  Either of the datastructures are implementable with arrays. However using this is up to you. 

  Using an array for a stack is fine. For a queue this might not be ideal because of the array shifting would actually be worst in terms of time complexity.

  ### Stacks

  #### **LIFO** (Last In First Out)

  These are useful when you want to find the last item in the strutucre.
  Call Stacks
  Browser History
  Edit / Undo 

  There are three main methods:
  1. lookup
  2. pop 
  3. push
  4. peek


  ### Queues 

  #### **FIFO** (First In First Out)

  Use Cases:
  Wait list 
  Restaurant apps
  Uber / Lyft

  | Methods | Description                                                  | Big O time complexity |
  | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
  | pop     | Retrieve the next item from either data structure            | O(1)                  |
  | push    | Adds an item to to the next position of either data structure | O(1)                  |
  | peek    | Grabs the next value in either order for either datastructure | O(1)                  |
