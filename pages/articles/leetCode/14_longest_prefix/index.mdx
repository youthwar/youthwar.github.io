  ## LeetCode 14 - Longest Common Prefix in array of strings
  ### Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. 
  Return an empty string if none is available.

  <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/" target="_blank">Problem Link</a>


  
  #### Some Examples: 

  ```
  input strs = ['car', 'boat', 'animal'];
  output = '' // there are no common prefixes
  ```

  ```
  input strs = ['stigma', 'stephan', 'steven'];
  output = 'st'
  ```

  ### Explanation

  1. First lets just check that the we actually get an input.
  2. Take the first item and set that as the initial prefix;
  3. Loop over all the items, skipping the first (since that is our initial prefix);
  4. Create a while loop in which we check if the current string ( subsequent item in the array) contains the prefix in the begining (or the prefix).
  5. If it does (indeoxOf returns !== 0) we remove the last character and continue until we get a match
  6. At the end of this we return the prefix


  At the end of this we just return the prefix. So really since we take the first string and are removing the last characters (creating a new prefix ),
  theres no chance to have a prefix in the rest of the strings.

  #### In practice

  Heres what the prefix looks like in practice, taking our second example (since we have a common prefix):

  ```
    1st iteration: stigma
    2nd iteration: stigm
    3rd iteration: stig
    4th iteration: sti
    5th iteration st
    and we now have a match ! : st
  ```
