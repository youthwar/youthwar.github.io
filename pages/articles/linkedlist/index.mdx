  ## Introduction 
  Linked Lists are a loose structure, we can insert or remove items by just changing some pointers as opposed to allocating a new block of memory for every item in an array. 

  LL is a little bit slower because of the loose structure items might not be allocated next to each other in memory as it would be in an array.

  This might be better than a hash table because there is an order of our items.
  
  Traversing is typically done with a while loop because we dont know where it might end.

  Lastly Linked lists **almost** always have a reference to the head and the tail. Definitely the head.

  To Further illustrate the datastructure, in the code editor there is what this linked list would look like in object form. Further down we will implement one where it is loosely allocated.

  ## Basic Methods on a Linked List


  | Method  | Description                                                  | Big O time complexity |
  | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
  | prepend | Adds a node to the begining of the linked list               | O(1)                  |
  | append  | Adds a node to the very end of the list                      | O(1)                  |
  | Lookup  | Traverses the linked list and returns the item               | O(n)                  |
  | Delete  | Traverse the linked list removes the item by removing the references and then that removed item gets deleted in javascript by garbage collection | O(n)                  |
