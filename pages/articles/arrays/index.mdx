  ## Introduction

  Arrays are a datastructure that stores data sequentially (one after another). Arrays are iterable, meaning that you can start from any position or index and move in one direction or another.

  
  In most programming languages there are two different types of arrays. Static | Dynamic.


  In Javascript we can actually instantiate a new array with the size of array that we would want. In the example we can see how we can utilize this.

  ### Basic Methods on an Array

  | Method | Description                                                  | Big O time complexity                  |
  | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
  | push        | adds element to the end of an array                          | O(1)                                   |
  | pop         | removes the item at the end of an array and returns it       | O(1)                                   |
  | unshift     | adds an item at the begining of an array                     | O(n) // the length of the array        |
  | shift       | removes the item at the beginning of an array and returns it | O(n) // worst case length of the array |
  | splice      | removes an item at a given index and also gives you the oportunity to delete an item | O(n) // worst case length of the array |

  # Implementation

  This is an example of how we can implement an array from scratch. I am not saying you should do this but this is how one could be done if we wanted to.
