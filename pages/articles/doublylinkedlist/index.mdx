  ## Introduction 

  Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to singly linked lists. The only main difference here is that we take up more memory 
  as we need to reference not only the next node but the previous node that comes before it. 

  I am going to keep this as short as possible because you can reference the singly linked list page [here](/articles/linkedlist)

  This creats a circle reference where each node references the prior and so fourth. The main benefit of this is being able to traverse from either direction.

  # Implementation
  ** NOTE: I will not console.log this here because of the circular nature of this data structure just trust that this will work.
  
  ## Utility class
  1. Similar to the original node of a linked list. we just need to add a prev property.


  ## Constructor
  1. Takes in a value for the head create a new node.
  2. Since this is the first node, the head is also the tail.
  3. Initialize the length to 1.
  

  ## Append
  1. Create a new node instance. 
  2. Go to the current tail of the linked list and capture that value.
  3. Assign the captured tail .next property to the new node that was created.
  4. Assign the new Node's .prev value to the captured tail node.
  5. Assign this.tail to the new Node.


  ## Prepend
  1. Create a new Node instance
  2. Assign the new Nodes .next value to the currentHead.
  3. Assign the currentHeads .prev value to the new node created.
  4. Assign the head to the new node created.
  5. profit.


  ## Insert
  1. Create a new Node.
  2. Find and capture the leader (index - 1) by using the traverseToIndex ( index - 1);
  3. Capture the follower by referencing the leader.next. this is where we want to insert.
  3. Set the new Node.prev to the leader
  4. Set the leader.next to the new Node.
  5. Set the new Node.next to the follower.
  6. Set the follower.prev to the new node
  7. all linked back up :)
